1. Execute the "__main__" in the file "state_space_input_generator.py".
You can do it fron an IDE, or if you want to use the terminal (CMD in Windows),
Type: "python state_space_generator.py" or "python3 state_space_input_generator.py"
(For some OSs like Apple OS X)

2. All generated files will be in the "ssg_tester_generated_inputs" folder.
